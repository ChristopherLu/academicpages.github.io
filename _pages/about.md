**NEW: I will be starting as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/). Please drop me email if you want to work with me on Cyber-Physical Systems and Mobile Computing!**

From Feb. 2019, I am a post-doctoral researcher at University of Oxford, working on EPSRC Programme Grant Project "Mobile Robotics: Enabling a Pervasive Technology of the Future", led by Prof. [Paul Newman](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/ori-people/paul-newman/), Prof. [Ingmar Posner](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/ori-people/ingmar-posner/), Prof. [Marta Kwiatkowska](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/marta.kwiatkowska/) and Prof. [Niki Trigoni](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/niki.trigoni/).

I obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science at Oxford University, advised by Prof. [Niki Trigoni](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/niki.trigoni/) and Prof. [Andrew Markham](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew.markham/). My PhD study was generously funded by Google DeepMind.
Prior to joining Oxford, I received my MEng degree in 2015 from [Nanyang Technological University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) (NTU), advised by Prof. [Lihua Xie](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=Fmrv3J8AAAAJ&hl=en). 


Research Interest
======

Broadly, my research interests revolve around the systems and modeling challenges when computers collect and reason about data in the physical world. My work looks to design and implement *pervasive* and *trustworthy* systems that reliably work in the wild with limited human intervention.I argue for a **holistic** approach by leveraging tactics from machine learning, wireless communications, embedded systems, security, ubiquitous computing and robotics, and design novel methods at the boundaries of these areas.

<!-- my research aims to enable pervasive, autonomous and trustworth cyber physical systems (aka. Internet of Things) in the wild. To this end, I develop **multi-modal and cross-modal solutions** leveraging techniques from wireless sensing, machine learning and robotics. -->
