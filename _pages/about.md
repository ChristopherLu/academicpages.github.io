**I'm looking for highly-motivated PhD students working on utonomous Cyber-Physical Systems [(CPS)](https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/projects/cps/) and/or Artificial Intelligence of Things [(AIoT)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2019/12/20/what-is-the-artificial-intelligence-of-things-when-ai-meets-iot/#659d1501b1fd). Drop me an email if you are interested. Please include a CV to help me understand your background. **


I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Rutgers University at [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/). Before that I did both my PhD study and post-doctoral research in the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, advised by Prof. [Niki Trigoni](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/niki.trigoni/) and Prof. [Andrew Markham](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew.markham/). My PhD study was generously funded by Google DeepMind. Prior to Oxford, I received my MEng degree in 2015 from [Nanyang Technological University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) (NTU), advised by Prof. [Lihua Xie](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=Fmrv3J8AAAAJ&hl=en). 



<!-- From Feb. 2019, I am a post-doctoral fellow at University of Oxford, working on EPSRC Programme Grant Project "Mobile Robotics: Enabling a Pervasive Technology of the Future", led by Prof. [Paul Newman](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/ori-people/paul-newman/), Prof. [Ingmar Posner](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/ori-people/ingmar-posner/), Prof. [Marta Kwiatkowska](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/marta.kwiatkowska/) and Prof. [Niki Trigoni](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/niki.trigoni/). -->

Research Interest
======

Broadly, my research interests revolve around the systems and modeling challenges when computers collect and reason about **multi-modal data** in the physical world. I look to design and implement intelligent systems that can reliably and securely work in the wild. Within this broad notion, my research primarily focuses on the **cyber-physical systems** and **autonomous systems**, improving utility in data-sharing environments and performance of data-driven models for these systems. 

I argue for a **holistic** approach by leveraging tactics from wireless systems, machine learning, mobile robotics, usable security&privacy and design novel methods at the boundaries of these areas.

<!-- my research aims to enable pervasive, autonomous and trustworth cyber physical systems (aka. Internet of Things) in the wild. To this end, I develop **multi-modal and cross-modal solutions** leveraging techniques from wireless sensing, machine learning and robotics. -->
