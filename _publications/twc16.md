## Abstract
Abstract—Indoor positioning system (IPS) has become one of
the most attractive research fields due to the increasing demands
on location-based services (LBSs) in indoor environments. Various
IPSs have been developed under different circumstances, and most
of them adopt the fingerprinting technique to mitigate pervasive
indoor multipath effects. However, the performance of the
fingerprinting technique severely suffers from device heterogeneity
existing across commercial off-the-shelf mobile devices (e.g.,
smart phones, tablet computers, etc.) and indoor environmental
changes (e.g., the number, distribution and activities of people,
the placement of furniture, etc.). In this paper, we transform the
received signal strength (RSS) to a standardized location fingerprint
based on the Procrustes analysis, and introduce a similarity
metric, termed signal tendency index (STI), for matching standardized
fingerprints. An analysis of the capability of the proposed
STI to handle device heterogeneity and environmental changes is
presented. We further develop a robust and precise IPS by integrating
the merits of both the STI and weighted extreme learning
machine (WELM). Finally, extensive experiments are carried out
and a performance comparison with existing solutions verifies the
superiority of the proposed IPS in terms of robustness to device
heterogeneity.
