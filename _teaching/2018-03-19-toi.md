Role: Teaching Assistant.

Intro: The "Internet of Things" (IoT) is a generic term given to wireless networks of sensors and actuators that are IPV6 compliant. This module examines the fundamental properties of wireless communication and distributed data management, especially when subject to resource constraints such as limited battery power or memory. We focus on the "things" that actually create and deliver the data and place less emphasis on the cloud side of the IoT.
